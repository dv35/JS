    Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Dates are always objects

JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:

    string
    number
    boolean
    null
    undefined

A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.
A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.
Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).

          if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x. But you cannot change the value of 3.14.

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
The values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

          Example
          
          var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
