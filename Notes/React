React is often mentioned in the same breath as other Javascript frameworks, but "React vs Angular" doesn't make 
sense because they aren't directly comparable things. Angular is a complete framework (including a view layer), React is not.

React gives you a template language and some function hooks to essentially render HTML. That's all React outputs, HTML. 
Your bundles of HTML / Javascript, called "components", are allowed things like storing their own internal state in 
memory (such as which tab is selected in a tab view), but in the end you just output HTML. You absolutely cannot build 
a fully functional dynamic application with React alone.

Benefits of React

1.	You can always tell how your component will render by looking at one source file.
2.	Bundling Javascript and HTML into JSX makes components easily understandable.
3.	You can render React on the server.

No so beneficial side: 

1. You DO NOT GET any of the following:

        •	An event system (other than vanilla DOM events)
        •	Any AJAX capabilities whatsoever
        •	Any form of a data layer
        •	Promises
        •	Any application framework at all
        •	Any idea how implement the above
        
2. React is large for how little you get, including how little cross browser support.

React is about 35 KB gzipped over the wire.
React is a comparable size with Angular, even though Angular is a complete application framework. 
React is frankly bloated for how little functionality you get.
